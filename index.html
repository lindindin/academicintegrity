You’ve made it to a respectable amount of lectures, you feel like you know what’s going on in your modules and you’ve handed in your assignments on time so far. But this next one coming up hasn’t really grabbed you; the topic isn’t your favourite and it has clashed with some big events for your sports club. You’ve promised yourself you’ll do it tomorrow at least four times and now you only have 24 hours left until the due date. 

Do you

1. Decide to go to [[The Library]] to get things done?
2. Decide to stay [[at home]] ?
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="The Library" tags="" position="1050,400" size="100,100">The library is quiet – too quiet. You’re struggling to concentrate and everyone around you much more focussed.

Do you

1. Meet up with some friends on level 2 to have [[a friendly chat]] ?
2. Get some books and knuckle down to find [[useful]] information? 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="at home" tags="" position="900,525" size="100,100">You stick your favourite study music on and type away. It’s hard going, but you get some writing done. Your lecture notes really aren’t up to scratch though, and you can’t find everything you need. 

Do you

1. Go for [[a friendly chat]] to see if your friends can help out?
2. Go on an [[useful]] article hunt online?
3. Just make do with what you’ve got hoping for the [[best]]? 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="a friend" tags="" position="775,525" size="100,100">Turns out they paid a little more attention in class and have some notes you could really use for your assignment. 

Do you
1. Ask them to borrow their notes, have a read over them and then write the paragraph you were struggling with?

2. Ask them to borrow their notes, read over them, then ask which part of the lectures the important information was in so you can rewatch it and make [[your own notes]]?
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="a friendly chat" tags="" position="900,650" size="100,100">You  pack up your things and head to level 2. Your friends have grabbed a table and everyone is chatting about the assignment. [[a friend]] seems to really be on it. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="useful" tags="" position="1025,650" size="100,100">You find some quotes that look useful and spend a couple of hours looking through them. You end up with a lot of notes from multiple sources which you think will elevate your essay. 

Do you

1. Look up the [[referencing guide]] for your subject on the library website and use it to meaningfully incorporate the quotes you’ve found?
2. Put the quotes into your essay as [[best]] you can, promising yourself you’ll fix it before hand-in? 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="referencing guide" tags="" position="900,775" size="100,100">The referencing guide helps you to properly incorporate the quotes you have found into your essay. You use the correct referencing system for all direct quotes, but aren&#39;t really sure about rephrasing. 

Do you

1. Just write what you think and hope for the [[best]]?
2. Contact SLS hoping they can help you in time? IS THIS A USEFUL LINK?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="best" tags="" position="1525,700" size="100,100">You muddle on, doing what you think is right without double-checking - there&#39;s no time for that. You submit your essay with a few hours spare, but to your horror Turnitin comes back with a high similarity score!

Do you

1. Look at it quickly and decide it&#39;s probably [[fine]] as the first few things you see are referenced?
2. Read through the whole report and use the [[referencing guide]] to double check your work?
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="fine" tags="" position="1525,825" size="100,100">You submit after a quick check. Three weeks later you have an email - your essay has been flagged for plagiarism and you have a meeting to attend. 

INSERT SOMETHING HERE ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="your own notes" tags="" position="1650,700" size="100,100">You use your friend&#39;s notes to remind you what to look for, then go back and make your own notes on the lecture. Rewatching the material makes things fall into place and you finish the essay without any further problems. </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
